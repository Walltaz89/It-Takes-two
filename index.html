<p>This site is dedicated to Examining the "It Takes Two" game and what i liked about it.</p></div>

<div>
<h2>What the game is about</h2>
<p> A clashing couple comteplating divorce are suddenly turned into dolls. Trapped together in different bodies cody and May must now follow the tasks given
   to them by a magical love guru book in order to return to their original bodies. Its a genre-bending platform adventure created purely for co-op.
   It is the ultimate light-hearted and touching story of the challenges in getting along

<h3>The best elements of the game</h3>
<p> What i loved about the game. </p>
<ul>
  <li>graphics</li>
  <li>storytelling</li>
  <li>gameplay</li>
</ul>
<p> I loved the story aspect of the game and how intertwined the story and gameplay were. In the beginning of the game I could see strain on Codys and Mays relationship and how that affected gameplay.
  Eventhough their world changed in a magical way they couldnt apperciate it because they were stuck together, But going futher in to the game the environments became more magical and whacky and their 
  relationship improved. I got to see their relationship develop back into a friendship.
